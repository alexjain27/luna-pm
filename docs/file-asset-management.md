# File & Asset Management Requirements

This document captures the requirements for documents and assets in Luna PM.

## Scope

- Documents and assets are stored in folders.
- Folders can be organized with subfolders (nested hierarchy).
- Documents and assets can be associated with tasks.

## Folder Locations

- Client view
  - Each client has a folder tree that contains client-level documents.
- Project view
  - Each project has its own folder tree.
  - When viewing a project, only folders associated with that project are visible.

## Task Associations

- Documents and assets can be linked to tasks.
- A task can have multiple associated documents/assets.
- The same document/asset may be linked to multiple tasks when needed.

## Visibility Rules

- Client view shows only that client’s folder tree.
- Project view shows only that project’s folder tree.
- Task views show only documents/assets linked to that task, plus a reference to the folder they live in.
